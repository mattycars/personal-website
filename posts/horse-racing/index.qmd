In this project, I predict horse racing winners and podium finishers at the Hong Kong Jockey Club. I use a variety of statistical methods including Naive Bayes, Random Forests, AdaBoost Models, and Gradient Boosting, specifically XGBoost. I was able to develop a model that, at the 1200m distance, under a specific set of race conditions, can predict horse racing finishers with around a 50% precision.

This project was completed as a part of DSAN 5000: Data Science and Analysis, an intro class in my first semester at Georgetown.
