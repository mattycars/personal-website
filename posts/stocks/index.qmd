In this project, I worked with a couple partners to develop an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline that extracts stock market data from Polygon.io's stock API and then creates a daily report before the market opens that day, highlighting market performance of the previous trading day. The pipeline runs automatically every morning with the help of a deployment on Prefect and sends us an email of the created stock report.
