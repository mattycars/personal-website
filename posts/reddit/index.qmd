I completed this project with 3 other group members as a part of my Big Data and Cloud Computing Class (DSAN 6000). We used AWS and Azure to process over 1 terabyte of Reddit data in order to see if we could develop a restaraunt review mechanism using restaurant/food subreddits and natural language processing (NLP). The link to our final website can be found [here](https://gu-dsan6000.github.io/fall-2024-project-team-02-1/). 

All additional code can be found in this GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/gu-dsan6000/fall-2024-project-team-02-1.git).
