In this project. I use raw image data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict avalanches. I was able to develop a model with an accuracy of 77.7% in predicting avalanches and an
accuracy of 80.6% for the TYPE of avalanche.

This project was completed as a part of a Computer Vision class I took at Georgetown.

All code for this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xwRCqHGi_5uGJSOy6vS750eqBVABIDEY?usp=drive_link). Because the dataset was so large, I worked in Google Colab. I have yet to set up git for this project due to complications in having git set up in conjunction with Google Colab, so for now, it is resting on GoogleDrive.
