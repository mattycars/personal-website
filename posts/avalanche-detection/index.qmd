In this project. I use raw image data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict avalanches.

This project was completed as a part of a Computer Vision class I took at Georgetown.

All code for this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xwRCqHGi_5uGJSOy6vS750eqBVABIDEY?usp=drive_link). Because the dataset was so large, I worked in Google Colab. I am lazy and have yet to set up git for this project, so for now, it is resting on GoogleDrive.
