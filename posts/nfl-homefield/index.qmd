In this project, I, along with a group, explore how NFL teams perform when they are the home team versus when they are the away team. We were able to quantify home field advantage by looking at a variety of NFL data including game-by-game data, win probabilities, and Elo ratings created by FiveThirtyEight. All code can be found [here](https://github.com/anly512/5300-project-group-29.git).

Below you will find the presentation we delivered to faculty on our analysis which provides a general overview of our project and its findings.
