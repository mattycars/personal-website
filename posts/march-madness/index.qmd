In this project, 3 other group members and I developed a project that explores what goes into an upset in the NCAA Basektball Division I March Madness Tournament. We were able to develop a model that is able to predict upsets with a 78% accuracy. We explored various ML/DL techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Below is the poster we presented to faculty in the Georgetown Data Science program.
