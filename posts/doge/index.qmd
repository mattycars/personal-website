In this project, for my Deep Learning Class (DSAN 6660), I used neural networks to predict anomalous market behavior in the Dogecoin market, a popular cryptocurrency. More specifically, I use an LSTM autoencoder. There is no other existing literature that uses these methods relating specifically to Dogecoin. My final report can be found below.

Below is the presentation I gave to my class and professors at the end of the semester.
