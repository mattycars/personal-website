I am graduating early this Winter and am currently looking for a full-time work opportunity in the data science field. I graduated undergrad from the University of Virginia in 2022 with a degree in Statistics and Econometrics.\nMy interests exist in some sort of vast Euclidean space between AI/deep learning, economics, sports and sports handicapping, tech, and sustainability. I also am a marathoner, snowboarder, mountaineer, SCUBA diver, and beginner skydiver who is always up for an adventure. Enjoy your stay here and feel free to reach out about anything!"

Because the dataset was so large, I worked in Google Colab. I have yet to set up git for this project due to complications in having git set up in conjunction with Google Colab, so for now, it is resting on GoogleDrive."

We do all of these analyses through a “scrollytelling” to find WHY car thefts are increasing in DC.\nThe project can be at this link, hosted by one of of my peers that I worked on the project with."
